### This manual page is detailing a highly experimental and incomplete feature that is in the process of being implemented. Everything on this page, while as detailed as it may be, is subject to change. ###

Activities in Might & Fealty are the umbrella term for referring to any multi-character event in game that is not a battle that has mechanics to support it.

At the time of this writing the following activities are planned or in some stage of development, and may appear in upcoming updates.

[duels]
-----
Duels are a catch-all term for any one versus one combat or sparring. They can be used to test skills against one another or to settle a blood feud. Or anything in between.

Tournaments
-----------
These can be anything from a singular grand melee or a massive, multi-hundred member, round-robin style double-knockout event, based around any of the implemented skills.
