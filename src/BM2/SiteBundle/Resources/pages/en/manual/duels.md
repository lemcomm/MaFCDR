When your honor has been slighted or you just feel like a friendly spar, or anything in between, duels are here to resolve things.

Duel Declaration
----------------
A declaration that you wish to duel someone can be sent to anyone in the vicinity. This includes a number of options, such as:

* Duel Name - For when you want your spectactle to be remembered a certain way.
* Character to Duel - Whoever you wish to engage in a solo combat of arms.
* To What Extent - In order of average length: first blood, wound, surrender, or death
* Use the Same Weapon - Requires both participants to utilize the same weapon.
* Weapon - The weapon you wish to use.
* Weapons Only - Determines whether or not other gear is considered, like horses or armor. (See Note 1)

Note 1: This only really matters in a few situations. First Ones are always able to take full advantage of their armor or lack thereof, so the defense value armor provides is always the same regardless of what is worn or how heavy it is. Equipment can make this fluctuate quite a bit, as can mounts though. If you're unsure, or don't trust who you're challenging, force this to weapons only for the fight to have the least variability to it.

Resolution
----------
Similar to how [battles] work, duels resolve in stages where both sides always attack and always get a result, meaning a duel to the death in Might & Fealty can result in both participants dying of their wounds. There's also always a chance that a duel will be more severe than intended, particularly with uneven match-ups in skills. Finally, there is an exception to both sides attacking and getting a result for every round. If one side is using a ranged weapon and the other isn't, the ranged side will get a free attack of opportunity. If the attacked survives this round, the ranged user will suffer a penalty for no longer being able to maintain distance from the second round on.

Results
-------
A duel will always end one of three ways, the challenger wins, the challenged wins, or a tie takes place when both members of the duel suffer a sufficient amount of damage to trip the extent limit during the same match. On a related note, the game will not tell you who is more wounded when this happens--there are no doctors in Might & Fealty capable of understanding First Ones other than other First Ones, and they can't be trusted to not bend the story to suit their needs.
