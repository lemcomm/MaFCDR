description:
 bridge: >
   Brücken erlauben es, Flüße zu überqueren, selbst mit einer Armee oder schwerer Ausrüstung. Sie sind oft strategisch 
   wichtige Bauwerke.

 tower: >
   Der Wachturm bietet einen erhöhten Punkt um die Umgebung im Auge zu behalten. Er ist keine Verteidigungsanlage, weil er nicht 
   befestigt ist.<br />
   Wenn ein Wachturm in Deiner Sichtweite ist, bekommst Du automatisch Zugang zur Sichtweite des Wachturms, weil Deine Späher 
   ihn benutzen, um ihre eigene Übersicht zu verbessern.

 borderpost: >
   Der Grenzposten kann nur ein Grenzstein sein, oder ein kleiner Posten mit Zollhäuschen und einigen Grenzern. Welche Form 
   er auch annimmt, er markiert den Übergang zwischen zwei Territorien.<br />
   Grenzposten dienen hauptsächlich als Übergangspunkte für Straßen zwischen zwei Siedlungen.

 signpost: >
   Wegweiser sind mit Richtungen beschriftet und stehen meist an Kreuzungen. Das gilt auch umgekehrt: Wo ein Wegweiser ist, 
   treffen oft Straßen aufeinander, weil die Menschen den Richtungsschildern folgen.<br /> 
   Wegweiser sind Punkte, die für den Straßenbau wichtig sind.

 docks: >
   Ein Anleger erlaubt es, Schiffen anzulegen, von denen aus dann in See gestochen werden kann.<br />
   Dieses Bauwerk erlaubt es, zwischen See- und Landreisen zu wechseln.
