 intro:      From here you can formally create a new place at this location, either inside a settlement if you're in one, or outside one if you are not.

  name:      View Local Places of Interest
  intro:     Anyone with permission of the local lord can create a place of interest. Places of interest are semi-permanent, player created, in-game locations that share many functions with settlements. Places of interest allow realms and houses to establish an arrival location for new characters, with customized introductions to inform and attract new players. Eventually these will be expanded to exist as the gateway to player complexes which will allow you describe your world in more detail than ever before.
