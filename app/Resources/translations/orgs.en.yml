   header: Formalize a New Association
   intro: <p>Associations are a term of many meanings within Might & Fealty. They represent any player organization that is not representing a government (realms) or familial-esque (houses) structure. In other words, these are the guilds, cults, brotheroods, secret societies, religions, orders, companies, and corps you'd find in other games.</p><p>It should be worth noting that one option here has fairly reaching impact. Unlike Houses and Realms which are, by design, public, Associations need not be. You can decide the moment you create it that you don't want this association to be Public, and that only members of it should know about it.</p><p>Finally, there is one last thing you should understand about Associations in M&F. Type is only what your association styles itself as, and has no formal functionality beyond that. You can be the Gold Star Merchant Company that believes in a pantheon or a Temple of Fire Lake that operates exclusively to sell mercenary contracts. How your Association works is entirely up to you to decide.</p>
  createRank:
   header: Create a New Rank within the Association
   intro: <p>Ranks are a simple thing that help you manage the structure of the organization. Some of these options are overruled by association laws (like Rank Visibility and viewability) while others always take effect. If you're unsure what an option does, additional help is available for each.</p>
   name:   Create a New Rank
   desc:   Add a new rank to this assocciation
  faith:
   name: Declare Your Faith
   intro: You can always decide that you simply which to, at least nominally, follow one faith or another that you're part of. Any Association that you are a member of that has named what their faith and followers is called is eligible to pick from. All regions you own will follow your choice here.
   success: You've successfully changed your official religion to that of %faith%.
   success2: You've successfully changed your official religion to that of not having one.

   description:  Associations can be completely transparent or absolutely arcane, by design. Unless you run the association, this is only the ranks you've been allowed to see by whoever created the rank you hold, if you even hold one. Unlike realms, there's no retiring ranks, and no history of them.
   empty:  If there's nothing here it is probably because you don't hold a rank of your own. You should reach out to whoever invited you or approved your joining to fix this.

   intro: <p>Associations are a term of many meanings within Might & Fealty. They represent any player organization that is not representing a government (realms) or familial-esque (houses) structure. In other words, these are the guilds, cults, brotheroods, secret societies, religions, orders, companies, and corps you'd find in other games.</p><p>Unlike other games, these entities tend to be very free form. Functionally, they all have access to the same options, a mercenary company can have a patron saint or a temple can run trade routes--this is up to the association to decide.</p>
