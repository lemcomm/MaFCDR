  intro: >
    Quests are tasks given by the local lord to anyone who feels like completing it. They also have a reward attached that is offered to sometimes
    the first and sometimes everyone who completes it. All the details are specific to the quest, so read them carefully.

    The ships can land you at most coastal locations, but you can only embark at a dock with the appropriate permissions or, of course,
    return to where you landed as your ships will wait for up to 30 days for you there. This means if you are not careful, landing can be a one-way trip.<br />
    To land, simply travel towards land. You will disembark at the first point where your travel hits solid ground.

  intro: >
    You can give your ship to someone else, so that First One can use it, instead of you. Because once you have given your ship
    away, you can not use it yourself anymore.<br />
    Giving a ship away does not extend the time the captain will wait, it is still 30 days after you landed.

 inn:
  name:         Visit Inn
  description:  Get a drink and check for rumours and mercenaries.
  intro: >
    In the inn, you can hear rumours from abroad, especially about what other lords offer for prospective knights. And if
    you are looking for sell-swords, soldiers of fortune, men-at-arms - in a word: Mercenaries, the inn is where you will
    most likely find them.<br />
    They are usually easy to spot as they are looking for employers the same way you are looking for them. Their services,
    however, are less easy. They will follow you as long as you pay them well. You can also not retrain, assign or set them
    as militia. And you can only disband them all at once.
 library:
  name:         Library
  description:  Visit the scholars and cartographers at the local library.
  intro: >
    At the library of %settlement%, scrolls and maps are available for your perusal. The local scholars and cartographers have collected

  intro: >
    The local temple of %settlement% keeps a record of births and deaths, allowing you to trace back
    the settlement's development through time.<br />
    The priests have prepared a nice graph for you. As they explain, the height of the line shows the population, and the
    far right is yesterday, while the line further to the left goes into the past, with the number at the bottom showing how
    many days into the past.
 barracks:
  name:         Inspect Barracks
  description:  Inspect the local barracks and soldier records.
  intro: >
    Thanks to local barracks of %settlement% providing housing for its soldiers, it can also keep a record of militia
    within the settlement.<br />
    A clerk has prepared a nice graph for you. As he explains, the height of the line shows the number of militia in the
    settlement on any given day, with higher meaning more. The far right shows yesterday, while the line further to the
    left goes into the past, with the number at the bottom showing how many days into the past.<br><br>

    You can leave one of your spies behind in this settlement, and they will keep you updated about everything that is going on,
    supplying you with access to the settlements event log and local details, just as if you were there yourself.<br />
    Over time, the spy might be discovered, or disappear.
  intro2: >
    You can send one of your spies to infiltrate this settlement. There is a reasonable chance that they will make it inside, but
    they could also be captured during the attempt. If he makes it, they will keep you updated about everything that is going on,
    supplying you with access to the settlement's event log and local details, just as if you were there yourself.<br />
    Over time, the spy might be discovered, or disappear.

 name:          Local control actions
 all:           All control actions
 take:
  name:         Take control
  description:  Declare your lordship over these people and make this settlement yours.
  intro: >
    In order to command the resources and population of this %type%, you need to take control of it first.<br />
    This process simply takes time. In a small settlement, you simply convince the people directly, while in larger settlements you
    will take control of the local administration.<br />
    The amount of time required depends on the settlement size and on forces supporting and/or opposing you. This includes the local militia,
    which will automatically oppose you.<br />
    Taking control of this settlement will take an estimated %time%, if nobody else interferes.
  newbie: >
    Are you absolutely sure you know what you are doing? This is a <i>hostile action</i> on a settlement owned by another player.
    Your character is new in the game and could easily <i>be killed</i> in retaliation.<br />
    Unless you are certain and know what you are doing, talking to the settlement owner via the <a href="%url%">messages tab</a>
    is very likely a much better idea.
  limit:      With a free account, you can control at most three estates with each character. Keep that in mind and select carefully, or support the game with a subscription.
  long: >
    You noticed that it will take a very long time to take control here? If you know what you are doing, go ahead,
    we won't stop you, but probably you should bring more troops, reduce the militia by attacking first or gain the support
    of allies who will aid you.
  owned:        This settlement is currently controlled by %owner%.
  others:
   title:       Other Control attempts
   intro: >
     The following First Ones are also currently trying to take control of this settlement. Without diplomacy or battle, this will likely result in
     a mess of conflicting claims resolving over time. If you want to take control yourself, you will almost certainly have to make them all stop,
     either by convincing them or by attacking them.<br />
     Your other alternative is supporting someone else, which will speed up their process of taking the settlement.
  defended: >
    Defending forces are making it more difficult to raise your banner. Attacking and culling them first might speed up your action.
  undefended: >
    There are no defending forces at this settlement, making it very easy and quick to take control.
  realm:        In the name of
  submit:       Take control
  success:      You are now in the process of taking control of this settlement. The process will take an estimated %time%, though this estimate will change with the support or opposition of other First Ones.

  description:  Your estate is currently being claimed by others, oppose them.
 changerealm:
  name:         Change realm allegiance.
  description:  Decide to which of your realms this settlement is aligned.
  intro: >
    As the owner of %settlement%, you decide which realm it is considered to belong to. While this is a simple
    matter of declaration to change, the political consequences can be massive, so consider them well.<br />
    Also remember that your membership in realms depends on you holding estates within their hierarchy, so changing
    the allegiance of a settlement can result in you leaving a realm if it is your only estate within.
  current:      %settlement% is currently a part of %realm%.
  nocurrent:    %settlement% is not considered part of any realm at this time.
  realm:        Change to realm
  submit:       Change allegiance
  success:      You have successfully changed the allegiance of this settlement to %newrealm%.
  leftrealm:    Since you now hold no estates within %oldrealm% anymore, you are no longer a member of that realm.
  fail:
   same:        The settlement already belongs to this realm.
 grant:
  name:         Grant control
  description:  Hand over control over these people to another First One.
  intro: >
    Settlements you control can be handed off to someone else.<br />
    Note that this does <em>not</em> make the recipient your vassal automatically. This action merely hands
    over control, questions of vassalage and legitimacy are for you to resolve.
  introwr: >
    You can grant a settlement "with its realm", meaning you make the new lord a member of the realm the settlement
    belongs to. Alternatively, you can grant without, which makes the settlement independent before granting it and
    is useful to giving settlements away to other realms.
  to:           Grant control to
  withrealm:    With realm?
  withrealm2:   If you grant an estate "with realm", the estate will stay in its current realm and the new lord will join that realm if he is not already a member.
  keepclaim:    Keep claim?
  keepclaim2:   If you keep a claim to the estate, you grant it "in fief", but you continue to consider it your property. The claim will allow you to take it back easily.
  success:      You have now given control over this settlement to %newowner%.
  queued:       You will soon be meeting with %newowner% and arrange the details of the transfer, as well as informing the settlement leaders.
 steward:
  name:         Appoint Steward
  description:  Delegate most of your responsibilies.
  intro: >
    Any settlement you control fully can have an appointed steward to manage it in your stead. This individual has the vast majority of your same abilities over the lands they're appointed to, but cannot grant control or appoint their replacement.
  to:           Appoint
  success:      You have now appointed %name% as your new Steward.
 rename:
  name:         Rename settlement

  intro:        As the lord of this %type%, you can change its name to make it easier to distinguish, or to placate your ego.

  submit:       Change name
  tooshort:     Settlement names should be at least 3 characters long.
  success: >
    You have now declared that this place shall be known as "%newname%".<br />
    Maps and signs will be updated at once.
  queued: >
    The settlement leaders have been instructed to change the name of this place to "%newname%".<br />
    Maps and signs will be updated over the next few hours. You will see the change completed soon.
 culture:
  name:         Change culture
  description:  Change the culture of this settlement.
  intro: >
    As the lord of this <em>%current%</em> %type%, you can change its culture.<br />
    The culture of a settlement defines its flair, visuals and the names of the entourage and soldiers recruited here.<br />
    This should be used sparingly, as it would be unrealistic to change all the time. It also makes a lot more sense to
    communicate with your neighors and set up cultural areas.<br />
    <br />
    The central european culture is available to everyone. Additional cultures can be bought on your account page (Credits and Gifts).
    If you conquer a settlement belonging to a culture you do not own, it will retain its culture, but you can only change
    settlements to cultures you own.
  newculture:   New culture
  success: >
    You have now declared that this place follows the %culture% culture.
  queued: >
    The settlement leaders have been instructed to adapt to a %culture% culture.<br />
    You will see the change completed soon.
 permissions:
  name:         Manage permissions
  description:  Set and change permissions for others
  intro: >
    As lord of %settlement%, you can determine how the settlement officials should treat others, if they should allow them
    into the settlement at all, if they can use the resources of the settlement to resupply or even pick up recruits.<br />
    To make everything more accessible, this system uses the <a href="%listsurl%">lists system</a> to define permission owners.
  general:      General permissions
  specific:     Specific permissions
  spawn:        Allow new characters to spawn here?
  thralls:      Allow slavery (thralls) ?
  feedsoldiers: Allow knights to pull food for their soldiers?
  submit:       Set new permissions
  success:      Your new permissions have been saved.
 quests:
  name:         Manage quests
  description:  Create and edit quests for this settlement
  intro: >
    As lord of %settlement%, you can set quests for other characters passing by to complete.<br />
    A quest can be absolutely any task that you can describe in words and where you can determine if it was completed or not. It will
    be written on message boards everywhere inside the region, so it is available to anyone who enters the region, even if they
    do not or are not allowed to enter the settlement itself.<br />
    Quests should also contain a reward. This as well can be anything. Quests can be completed once or many times, as you wish. In
    essence, quests are entirely free-form and you determine everything, including if you will give out the promised reward or betray
    the First One that finished your quest.<br />
    Quests are public knowledge, so other people can see all past and current quests, who has taken them up, if they think the quest
    was completed, if you agree and if they consider the reward to be received or not.
  new:          Create New Quest
  create: >
    To create a quest, describe the task to do and the reward given.<br />
    You can give a short summary, a long description and a description of the reward. You should include all important information,
    including whether the quest reward will be given only to the first to complete it, or to multiple people, and on which conditions,
    such as evidence of conclusion, or time limits.
 abandon:
  name:         Abandon Settlement
  description:  Reliquish control of this settlement.
  help: >
    As the rightful owner or occupant of %settlement%, you can always decide that you simply don't want to be in control any longer.<br><br>
    If you're the owner, you can also decide if you simply wish to be rid of the region, or for you AND your realm to be rid of the region.<br><br>
    Additionally, if you are the owner and there is an ongoing occupation of this land when you abandon it, it will default to the occupier's control if you do not set it to stay in the realm.<br><br>
    If you are the occupant, any abandoning of the occupation will also end any associated realms occupation of it.

  success:      Settlement has been abandoned.

   description: Change this settlement's description.
   help: >
    From here you can change the description of this settlement, which will display publicly whenever someone views the settlement details.
    This will be displayed regardless of whether they are in spotting distance or interaction range, and can be viewed by anyone, even people
    who aren't logged in. It's also worth noting that these are stored in perpetuity, and in the future you'll be able to view historical
    descriptions of locations.
  artifact:
   name:        Change Artifact Description
   help: >
    Unlike Settlements and Places, Artifact descriptions are intended to tell a story about the artifact, about how it was created, and
    how it changed when it changed hands. The goal with artifact descriptions is to tell a narrative, which is why unless you created the
    last description(s), you won't know what the previous descriptions were.
  full:         Edit Text
  success:      Description has been updated successfully!

  submit:       Begin Occupation
 occupationstart:
  name:         Occupy Settlement
  description:  Declare an occupation of this settlement?
  intro: >
    Now that you're inside %settlement% you're in a good position to delcare an occupation.<br /><br />
    By declaring an occupation, you will be effectively be making yourself psuedo-owner, and the regular owner will have his own privileges revoked.
 occupationend:
  name:         End Occupation
  description:  Declare an end to the occupation?
  intro: >
    As either the occupant of %settlement%, or any first one in an undefended but occupied settlement, you are well within your capabilities to declare an end to the occupation of this settlement. If they aren't here to defend their claim, that's their problem.

  description:  Review the units supplied by this estate.
  intro: >
    Units in Might & Fealty are owned by the estate they are based from, but they're not necessarily supplied by the same.<br>
    In certain situations it may be fortuitous to close that supply line though. This page allows you to do that.<br><br>
    Of particular note is that if the unit is from here and is getting supplied from here, you'll be unable to cancel it--if you want the soldiers from their home settlement, you'll need to disband them instead.

  intro: >
    You are being attacked, and you may or may not be looking forward to this battle. As the enemy is still maneuvering to engage you,
    you can also still escape. With your current unit size, it will take %time% to pack up everything and leave, at which point you
    will find out if you succeed in making a run for it, or are already surrounded.
  battles:      Choose the battle(s) you want to disengage from
  submit:       Avoid battle
  success:      You have instructed your troops to pack up and avoid the upcoming battle. You might want to also travel away or you will probably be engaged again.

  description:  Evade enemy forces.
  longdesc:     Instruct your troops to automatically attempt to disengage from any battles you are forced into.
  intro: >
    You can instruct your troops to avoid any battles you are forced into. While this might sound like something you want to do all the time, also
    keep in mind that if you are travelling with a larger army of realm mates or allies, it might mean some of you evade the battle and others don't, splitting
    forces up.<br />
    This action will remain in effect until you cancel it and apply to any and all battles that you do not voluntarily join.<br />
    <br />
    Since enemy troops could enage you again after a successful evade, it is strongly recommended that you also set travel away from your
    enemy in order to avoid being re-engaged.
  submit:       Evade all battles
  success:      Your troops are now instructed to immediately disengage if a battle is forced upon you.

     Order your soldiers to attack %settlement%.<br />
     There will be a battle between your forces as well as any other attackers, against the settlement militia
     and anyone choosing to defend, who will benefit from local fortifications. If you are victorious, you have forced your way into the settlement, and actions such as taking control of the
     settlement for yourself or attacking First Ones inside will appear.<br />
     <i>Once initiated, battles cannot be cancelled. Once you are committed, you are committed. Decide wisely.</i>
   war:         War that this attack supports:
   submit:      Attack!

   reminder:    Remember that in order to not just attack, but also take control of the settlement, you need to issue a <a href="%url%">%take%</a> action as well.
  loot:
   name:        Loot settlement
   description: Plunder this settlement for valuables and resources.
   intro: >
     Looting enemy settlements allows you to take resources or thralls by force and transfer them to any estate of your choice (preferably yours, typically).<br /<
     You can also loot for personal profit or raid the workshops for supply, or simply burn the place down.<br />
     The more options you select, the longer everything will take and the more distributed the effects will be. To maximize the efficiency of specific goals,
     you should focus on one or two options.<br />
     Like battles, looting commits you - once you have initiated a looting action, you cannot cancel it or travel elsewhere, until it is complete.
   owner:       As you are the lord of this settlement, you can <i>steal wealth</i> very effectively with no negative effects. You will call this an unscheduled tax collection.
   outside:     As you are outside the settlement, you can only loot the countryside, which offers fewer targets. Fight, bribe or trick your way inside the settlement for more effective looting.
   time:        The selected looting options will take <span id="time">4</span> hours to complete.
   target:      Send plunder to
   options:     Loot actions
   option:
    thralls:    Take thralls
    resources:  Take resources
    supply:     Steal supply
    food:       Steal food
    wealth:     Steal wealth
    burn:       Burn down buildings
   submit:      Begin looting
  food:
   supplied:    You have authorized %character% to pull from %settlement%'s food stores.
   rejected:    You have denied the request of %character% to pull food from %settlement%'s stores.
 battles:
  initiate:
   name:        Initiate battle
   description: Prepare for battle with other First Ones.
   intro: >
     Face your enemies in battle by positioning your troops so they cannot easily retreat, forcing them into an encounter.<br />
     By declaring one or more primary targets, you decide who to engage. However, everyone within reach of the battle can join
     in on either your or their side, so you cannot be sure who you will face in the end.<br />
     You should include an in-character message with the attack, explaining why you are attacking or mocking your enemy or writing
     a short roleplay about the attack or anything else that gives the battle more depth.<br />
     Battle preparations take time depending on the size of the involved forces, so both you and your target(s) have a short time to call
     in allies for support.<br />
     If you are inside a settlement, you can only attack others who are also inside (but you can leave to attack those outside). If you are
     outside a settlement, you cannot attack First Ones inside a settlement, you will have to attack the settlement to get inside.<br />
     <i>Once initiated, battles cannot be cancelled. Once you are committed, you are committed. Decide wisely.</i>
   success: >
     You are now engaging the enemy and battle prepartions are being made on both sides, the estimated time until the battle will commence is %time%,
     but this could change as you and/or the enemy get more support.<br />
     Your enemy has been notified of the impending attack.

 aid:
  name:          Military aid
  description:   Support other First Ones in future battles.
  intro: >
    You can choose to always support other First Ones in their battles. This will make you automatically join any battles
    they are involved in, if they are in your interaction range.<br />
    The most common use for this is when you see an ally involved in a battle nearby to set travel there and also this
    action, so you immediately join after arriving at the battle, even if you are not online at that time. You can also
    use this action to defend nearby First Ones, much like the <b>defend settlement</b> action.<br />
    To protect you from unintended consequences, this action always has a time limit. You can choose one of three
    durations below. It will also always end once you have entered a battle. If your target is involved in multiple
    simultaneous battles, you will aid them in all.<br />
    <br />
    Note that you <b>can</b> have multiple military aid actions running for multiple target characters. They will be
    resolved in the order in your action queue, and you will only join the first character on your list that is in a battle.
  target:         Character to aid
  success: >
    You are now lending your aid to %character%, and will become involved in their battles.
 block:
  name:           Block area
  description:    Prevent others from passing through.
  longdesc:       Deploy your forces to block others from passing through your action range. Most effective at choke points like bridges.
  intro: >
    By blocking an area, you will (try to) prevent others from passing through it, by engaging them in battle if they get near.
    Obviously, this is most useful either at chokepoints such as bridges, passes, etc. or when working with others so you can cover a large area.<br />
    You cannot move while blocking. Your army will camp in the area and send patrols around. This allows you to automatically
    engage your targets at twice your normal interaction range.<br />
    Target selection uses the <a href=%listsurl%>lists system</a> in order to allow you to create sophisticated orders.
    Slumbering First Ones, however, will never be engaged. You can attack them normally, but for block area they will be ignored.<br />
    Note that this action will make you engage <i>any target on the list, irrespective of army size</i>. You could well find yourself
    in battle with a vastly superior enemy if you are not careful.<br />
    Blocking area can be cancelled at any time from your actions queue.

  intro: >
    "You can use your soldiers to tear apart features such as bridges, watchtowers or signs.<br />
    Typically, you do this to your enemy to disrupt them, but sometimes you may want to get rid of features in your own lands.<br />
    This action takes 4 hours, except for signs where it takes only 1 hour.<br />

 offers:
  name:         Knights offers
  description:  Set aside soldiers to offer to new knights swearing allegiance to you.
  intro: >
    Knights are lower nobles who fight in your name, using your soldiers. To attract new knights to your banner, you can set aside
    soldiers on your estate(s) that are available immediately to any knight on the condition of his loyalty.<br />
    Be aware of robber-knights, though. You should not make the majority of your troops available this way, or your new knights
    just might decide that looting or taking your estate is more rewarding.<br />
    <br />
    You can also automatically give the settlement to the new knight, turning them into a landed lord on arrival. In this
    case, no soldiers will be given (even if you select some). As the new lord, they will have command of the whole militia
    anyways. This is a risky option that you only want if getting rid of the estate is important to you. Giving an estate
    in this way always retains you an enforceable claim on the settlement.<br />
    <br />
    Also, you may be able to opt to attach one your realm(s) Welcomer Positions on the offer, so that the holders of that
    position also receive the new knight arrival messages, and can assist you with their welcoming.

  description:  Review and reclaim soldiers assigned to First Ones or settlements
  intro: >
    Soldiers you recently assigned to First Ones or settlements can be reclaimed as their loyalty still lies with you.<br />
    This option will only last for a limited time as the soldiers will form a bond with their new commander after a while,
    but it means you can be trusting with new knights, for example, because you can take your men back if they turn out
    to be cowards or traitors.<br />
    You cannot reclaim soldiers if they are still available to you in any way, being stationed at your own estates or
    you own characters. You can also not reclaim soldiers when the character they are assigned to is currently in battle
    preparations. Such reclaims will fail silently, but you can try again later.<br />
    Note that reclaiming soldiers means <b>you remain stationary with travel blocked for 2-4 in-game days</b> because
    the reclaimed soldiers need to march and join up with your party.
  submit:       Reclaim soldiers
  success:      After issuing your orders, %return% of your soldiers return (they have been assigned to group %group%). %lost% soldiers decided not to come back.

  traits:       Your character was born with two traits, inherited from parents and/or the family lineage. Here is what the genetic lottery gave you:
  appearance:
   name:      Appearance
   desc: >
    Is what others see when they meet your character. Body, clothing, demeanor, but also favorite horse or constantly present servant -
    whatever those who encounter the character will recognize and remember.<br />
    <em>This field is publicly visible on your character page.</em>
  personality:
   name:      Personality
   desc: >
    Describes the manner and behavior of your character, how he or she thinks and acts. It can include traits
    such as introvert or extrovert, quick to act or thoughtful, easy to anger or calm - or really anything that
    gives you and (some) others a better grasp on the character.<br />
    <em>This text is only visible to your family members and those in a relationship with this character.</em>
  secrets:
   name:        Goals & Secrets

     This field is for your notes and any information you have learnt that you want to remember that your
     character knows, as well as any ambitions and future plans. They are for you and in order to give meaning to

 rename:
  name:         Rename
  description:  Change character name
  intro: >
    You can change the name of your character at any time, but we <em>strongly</em> suggest that you keep this for
    events that would reasonably lead to a change of a person's name, such as marriage.<br />
    Also remember that your character name <b>must</b> be a proper name, not a silly name, not a codename, but a
    a plausible, actual name.<br />
    All name changes are recorded in your character's public history.<br />
    <br />
    You can also add a religious or political name or monicker that the character uses themselves or is being called
    by others. If you want your character to be known by something besides their name, this is the place to put it.
    Alexander "The Great" as well as "Brother Gregory" are examples from the real world.<br />
    The "known as" can be more free-form than the character name, but should still pass a common sense "would someone really be called like that in a medieval world?"
    test. In other words: No silliness, no modern or Internet speak, something that passes the giggle test when you
    imagine composing a letter starting with "My esteemed (...)".<br />
    If set, this name will be shown instead of the character name everywhere, but in <i>italics</i>.
    The character details page will show both.<br />
  newname:      New Name
  knownas:      Add a "known as"
  submit:       Rename character
  success:      Your character has been renamed.
 retire:
  name:         Retire
  description:  Retire this character
  intro: >
   Your can decide to make your character retire from active life at any time they are not captive.<br />
   This action will make your character lose all their titles, holdings, conversations, soldiers, and position on the map,
   so it shouldn't be taken lightly. You will also have to wait, at a minimum, a few days to return them to activity.

  submit:       Leave the politics behind
  success:      Your character has entered their retirement, successfully.

  description:  Kill this character
  intro: >
    You can kill your character at any time.<br />
    This action will merely make your character dead without any reason given. You should roleplay an appropriate death
    so history and your fellow players know how %he% died.<br />
    <div class="warning">This action cannot be undone or reversed.</div>
