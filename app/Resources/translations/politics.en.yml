  longdesc:     View the tree of oaths that you belong to. (might take a short while to generate for large trees)
 name:          Offer a New Oath of Fealty
 intro: >
   Fealty is what defines the hierarchy and political system. What exactly an oath contains - vassalage, military service,
   shares of estate income, protection, honour and politics - is negotiable between liege and vassal.<br /><br />
   Here you can offer an oath of fealty to any position of authority, be it the lord of a settlement, the owner of a place of interest, a realm position holder, or even to a realm ruler directly, if the people holding that position are present. If you're inside a Settlement or a Place of Interest, and those are a viable choice, they will always be present.<br /><br />
   Who you hold an oath of fealty to defines your primary realm affiliation. Since your oath is to a position, not necessarily the person holding it, this should prevent confusing realm loyalties to some degree.
 hasvassals: >
   All your vassals will also become a part of the realm you join, as their oath to you binds them to your decisions. Of course,
   if you act against their will, they might leave you afterwards.
 isruler: >
   This action will mean the end of your realm as an independent entity.
 hasliege: >
   Your current oath will automatically be dissolved and your current liege, %liege%, will be notified.
 current:   Current oath
 swear:     Swear a new oath
 swearintro: Since a lord can hold estates in or be ruler of different realms, some lords may appear multiple times with different realms, and you get to choose which of their realms to join.

    If %name% has been disloyal to you, broken the oaths of fealty or otherwise justified this serious action,
    you can dissolve the fealty relationship below.<br />
    This is a serious action and will be marked in your vassal's history. You should also use the opportunity
    to visit their character page - %name% and leave a reputation comment.
  submit:       Disown
  success: >
    %name% is no longer your vassal.<br />
    You should also visit the character page and leave a reputation comment to indicate what caused you to
    take this drastic action.

rogue:
 name:        Go Rogue
 description: Declare independence.
 longdesc:    You can also break your oath without swearing a new one, becoming an independent lord or knight.
 intro: >
   You can break your oath of fealty at any time, declaring yourself independent, a rogue noble without realm or lord.<br />
   This step is not to be taken lightly, as other nobles can and will hunt you and your vassals for fame and fortune. Having no lord also
   means having no protection, both militarily and politically. Make sure you know what you are doing.
 submit:      Become a rogue noble
 success:     You are now an independent noble, or a rogue as your fellow nobles will consider you to be.

   You can select any character nearby enough to exchange documents, or anyone of your characters (as they are assumed to be
   from the same family or dynasty) irrespective of distance. Note that your estates, titles, etc. will leave your control
   if they are inherited by a character that does not belong to you.
 set:       Assign a new successor
 choose:    -- Choose successor --
 submit:    Set successor
 success:   You have now chosen %successor% as your new successor.

   new characters with these partners as parents.

  description:  Declare yourself ruler of your own realm.
  longdesc:     With vassals under your command, you can declare your own realm, joining the political arena and maybe attracting yet more followers to your banner.
  intro: >
    With sufficient power and no one above you, it might be time to step unto the stage of world politics. You can
    announce the lands under your control as a <i>realm</i>, which is a generic term for anything from a barony to
    an empire.<br />
    In fact, it is entirely up to you what to call your new realm. The only thing stopping you from calling three
    villages an empire is the ridicule of your peers. The proper mixture of ambition and modesty might be advisable.<br />
    You can change the designation of your realm later on.<br />

  submit:     Announce new realm
 manage:
  name:         Manage Realm
  description:  Change realm name, color and other details.
  longdesc:     As you are the ruler of %formalname%, you have complete executive control over your realm. Whether or not your vassals will stand for it if you exert it too freely, however, is a different question.
  intro: >
    As the ruler of %name%, you can change the realm's details at any time. Please note that realistically, these
    details almost never change, so make sure you have a good reason.<br />
    The designation of your realm must always stay above that of all inferior realms, limiting your choices.
  submit:       Announce changes
  success:      Realm details have been updated.

  name:         Dismantle Realm
  description:  Tear down this realm.
  longdesc:     As the ruler of %formalname%, it's within your authority to order it's complete and utter dismantling, if you so wish.
  intro: >
    Using your authority as ruler of %name%, you can forcibly dismantle this realm and remove it from existence.<br />
    If you're not absolutely certain that you wish to do this, you shouldn't even be looking at this. That's how serious this action is.<br />
    It's also worth noting that you are only dismantling this realm, not it's subordinates, who will automatically gain independence.
  sure:         You Absolutely Certain?
  success:      For better or worse, the realm has been taken down.

  intro: >
    As the ruler of %name%, you can change the realm's formal description at any time. Please note that these descriptions are recorded
    forever, and at some point, someone may be using your words to justify their war, long after your ruler is gone.
  submit:       Announce Changes
  success:      Realm details have been updated.

  description:  Renounce rulership and hand it to someone else.
  longdesc:     If you are tired of ruling %formalname% or are being forced out and want to leave graciously, you can hand over the reigns to someone else.
  intro: >
    As the ruler of %name%, you can abdicate and hand the reigns to someone else. Your successor has to be nearby (within action distance).
  done:         You have now given up rulership of this realm.

  description:  Select a new settlement to be the capital of your realm.
  longdesc:  From here you can determine, or redetermine, the capital of your realm, for whatever reason you so see fit. As to which region you can make your capital, well, you can determine ANY region of the realm to be your capital, though normally such a distinction is reserved for those cities that are either more developed or having of more significance. After all, if it's important to you, it's important to them, as well.
  estates:      Which estate shall be the capital of your realm?
  error:
   none:        To move or determine a capital, you need to select a region. Your advisors explain something about the critical nature of such a Seat of Power.
   already:     This region is already your capital. If you want to change it, you need to select a *different* region.
  submit:       By My Command!
  success:      Realm capital successfully changed.

  intro: Here you can alter the realm information that is displayed to players creating a new character or considering to join your realm at an Arrival location. This will display across all arrival locations for the realm of %name%, and should be used to describe the realm, not the locations you can spawn at. It is understood that this will also, likely, include propaganda about your realm, but that is your choice. <br /><br />It should be noted that this will only display in locations directly spawning into your realm, not your subrealms. They have their own, if you allow that.

  intro: In a realm, there are any number of formalized Places of Interest, many of which can be utilized as a place of arrival for your realm, that will allow foreign and newly introduced First Ones to join your realm. Ideally, you'll want to centralize to only a few places to allow first ones to arrive in your realm, in order to ensure they get the best new player experience you can offer.

  hashouse:     As you have been granted permission to make this house, your new house shall be a cadet of %house%.
  intro: >
   If you peer into the history books, you will usually find that Houses came before Realms. As to what a "House" is, well
   that really depends on the culture. Some were dynasties traced back by blood through eons, others were tribes, united
   by their believes or convictions. Others yet were more impromptu bonds, created through bloodshed or catastrophe.
   Whatever yours will be, that is up to you, and those who will be part of it.<br /><br />
   It is the right of any First One to declare themselves the head of a new House, or to formalize themselves as head
   of an already existing one. Like those who came before, you too, have this right. <br /><br />
   <em>As the creator of a house, your crest if you have one will become the crest of this house until it's demise.</em><br />
   If you don't have a crest, should you get one later it will be added automatically.<br />
   Alternatively, should your character die and another character inherit the house that has a crest, it will be set to theirs.<br />
   It is worth note however, that any of your future descendants will, if the other parent either has no house, or is part of the
   same house, also join your house automatically.<br />
   Lastly, be sure to set your successor after forming the house. If you don't set a successor, and your regular heir isn't a legal
   successor (see the manual on Houses) the House will automatically pass to it's eldest active member.<br /><br />
   <em>NOTE: Houses are not for guilds, associations, religions, cults, societies, or anything guild or religion like. Those will come in a future update.</em>

    leaves the Dynasty for some reason, the nominated Successor will no longer be a legal inheritor (usually). It is highly recommended
