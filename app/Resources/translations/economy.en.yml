description:
 bridge: >
   Bridges provide the necessary means to cross rivers, even with an army or heavy equipment. They are often
   important strategic points.
 tower: >
   The watch tower provides an elevated spot to watch for nearby activity. They do not serve as defensive
   structures and are not fortified.<br />
   Whenever a watchtower is within your spotting distance, you automatically gain access to the tower's spotting
   circle as your scouts use the tower to increase their own range.
 borderpost: >
   Sometimes just a border marker, such as a boundary stone, and sometimes a toll booth and small guard post.
   No matter the appearance, the border post shows where one crosses into a different territory.<br />
   Border posts are mostly used as meeting points of roads between settlements.
 signpost: >
   Marked with directions, signposts are usually posted near crossroads or intersections. It also works the
   other way around: Where a signpost is, a trail and then a road often follows, as people follow the
   direction signs.<br />
   Sign posts are spots that you can use to build roads to and from.
 docks: >
   Landing and embarkation location for ships and naval travel.<br />
   Docks allow travellers to switch between land and ocean travel.
 Academy: >
   Merging the knowledge of the university and the practical experience of the greatest military minds creates
   the great academy, where new strategies and tactics are discovered.
 Alchemist: >
   Usually set at the edge of the settlement, the alchemist is always expected to blow up spectacularily, but
   in reality most of the experiments are far less dangerous or spectacular. While much of the research done
   here is of questionable quality, there is the occasional poison or interesting substance discovered.
 Apothecary: >
   Sometimes called a herbalist, or a pharmacist, the apothecary formulates and dispenses medicinal herbs and drugs
   to other medical workers or even to patients directly. The inclusion of such an individual in a society is
   certain to aid in survival.
 Archery Range: >
   A reserved spot with targets and some wood walls to catch misfires. A place for archers to train and learn
   how to draw, aim and fire. Required if you want to train any kind of archers.
 Archery School: >
   The famous longbow requires more extensive training than other ranged weapons and the archery school offers
   just that, adding more versatility and greater ranges to the archery range.
 Arena: >
   An arena is a formal fighting area, surrounded by spectator seating for both commoners and the more affluent.
   It normally also houses areas for keeping slave fighters locked up, an area for storing weapons and equipment
   to be used in the fights, and sometimes even keeping more dangerous animals to be let loose on the competitors.
 Armourer: >
   A specialist creating all kinds of armor for your soldiers, the armorer combines cloth, leather and metal
   into some serious protection.
 Armoury: >
   Also known as an arsenal, the armory is a storage location for weapons and armors where they can also be
   kept in shape, organized and handed out quickly and efficiently. It is required for major fortifications.
 Bank: >
   A fortified building that can store valuables and treasures, as well as provide money-lending services and
   even issue special bond notes that can be exchanged for gold at some other banks.
 Barracks: >
   Housing and living rooms for soldiers, allowing full-time professional soldiers.
 Blacksmith: >
   Forge, anvil and loud noises - the blacksmith turns metal into tools for sale and simple weapons to equip soldiers.
 Bladesmith: >
   Specialised in swords, this craftsman knows the ancient secrets of how to make a blade both light and strong,
   and forge metal into swords.
 Bowyer: >
   A specialist craftsman who builds bows, crossbows and other personal ranged weapons.
 Carpenter: >
   Any kind of advanced wood workings require a carpenter, especially larger buildings whose frames are made of intricate
   wooden constructions.
 Citadel: >
   The ultimate in defensive constructions, the citadel is the envy of kings. This brutally massive construction is all
   but impenetrable and shrugs off even determined and well-equipped invaders.
 City Hall: >
   A large public building housing the administration as well as rooms for courts, archives and other essentials
   of an organized city.
 Dirt Streets: >
   More solid and reliable streets within the settlement allow for better travel and are required for some heavy transports
   and the buildings that require them.
 Dockyard: >
   The dockyard is an area in a settlement for processing and handling ships and their cargo and passengers. Some larger
   dockyards may also have shipbuilding capabilities, and many are capable of handling some smaller repairs.
 Empty Moat: >
   An empty moat, otherwise known as a ditch, is an excavated area of land around a fortification put in place to deliberately
   slow the advance of attackers. Normally, there is a bridge that can be let down to ease authorized travelers getting in and out.
 Fairground: >
   A larger and more permanent place of trade, the fairground allows for extensive trade and barter as well as special
   events which bring in traders from far away places and through trade increase the local wealth.
 Filled Moat: >
   A filled moat, or a ditch filled with water or other liquid, is used to considerably slow attacking forces approaching the walls
   of a fortification. Some filled moats may also include animals in the water that attack anyone who may be so unlucky as to fall in.
 Fishery: >
   A small port, boat yard and processing facilities for sea or lake fishing, adding more fish to the menu of the local inhabitants
   as fishermen can go further out with better boats and better nets than they could build by themselves.<br />
   Not the same as the dock feature, which is for military transport ships.
 Fortress: >
   Very few lords can afford the construction of one of these massive fortifications. A fortress is a reinforced stone
   castle with additional defensive and offensive constructions. It can be held against all but the most overwhelming
   attacks with but a modest force.
 Garrison: >
   A permanent heavy building to meet the needs of professional soldiers, from housing and gathering areas to weapons and
   armor storage as well as a permanent reserve that can be called out at short notice.
 Great Temple: >
   The largest and most impressive religious building, often a place that the faithful travel to from far away. Provides
   living room for its many priests and servants.
 Guardhouse: >
   A small house for the guards and soldiers of the settlement to gather and store their equipment, allowing for the
   training and recruitment of some basic soldier types.
 Guild District: >
   A larger and more formalized version of the Guild Square, the Guild District is an area in a city specifically set up by the
   administration for the dealings of the various guilds and associations.
 Guild Square: >
   A square or plaza within a settlement that has come to house various guilds and associations. Just the presence of the
   guild square is enough to draw some of the mortal guilds to a settlement, as having a guild square also entails a settlement
   having the administrative oversight to deal with guilds.
 Heavy Armourer: >
   A rare specialist for heavy armor who can work miracles with metal and create the rare and valuable plate armor - the
   ultimate in personal armor.
 Hunters Lodge: >
   A structure built for one or more woodland hunters in order to better take advantage of hunting in the area.
 Imperial Seat: >
   The Seat of Power for an Empire, the Imperial Seat supports the administration of such world powers, and contains
   the various bureaucratic workers and offices that keep it all working. The completion of such a complex array of offices
   and buildings tends to be quite an accomplishment.
 Inn: >
   The village inn or, for towns and cities, a collection of roadhouses, inns, brothels and similar places for travellers to
   rest and spend the night. This is where you can also find the odd talent to hire or meet shady figures at corner tables
   who can provide you with mercenaries.
 Irrigation Ditches: >
   A series of small canals and ditches bringing water from a river deeper into the nearby farmland, which will improve
   fertility, but at the cost of constant management tying up manpower that could work the fields otherwise. Not very
   useful in already fertile regions, but very useful in less fertile ones.
 Marsh Drainage: >
   A system of drainage ditches and fillings to make the fertile marsh for suitable for agricultural activity.
 Leather Tanner: >
   A basic craftsman who turns animal hides into leather and simple leather products.
 Library: >
   Storage place for books and manuscripts of both holy and secular importance. <br />
   This building is also required to create your own publications.
 List Field: >
   Sometimes more commonly referred to as 'The Lists', this is a location for holding Jousts.
 Local Seat: >
   The Seat of Power for a Barony or County, the Local Seat supports the administration of such powers, and contains
   the various bureaucratic workers and offices that keep it all working.
 Lumber Yard: >
   Central storage and processing area for woodcutting and forestry work. This improves the efficiency of woodcutting
   in the area, resulting in higher wood production.
 Market: >
   A place for merchants and local farmers to buy and sell their products. A market improves trade and the local economy,
   giving a slight boost to wealth.
 Mason: >
   A basic craftsman, the mason is required for stoneworks and buildings made of stone.
 Master Mason: >
   The most advanced masonry techniques of the age are known only to a select few craftsmen.
 Merchants Quarter: >
   An entire section of the settlement dedicated to trade and commerce, housing warehouses, an exchange, market places and
   guild houses.
 Mill: >
   Wind or water mills turn grain into flour, enhancing local food production. The miller usually takes a part of the grain
   for himself as payment, which makes him both well-off and disliked in most places. Nevertheless, the mill is a lot faster
   and involves less manual work than manual grindstones.
 Mine: >
   Ore and other valuables need to be dug up and that is what the miners do inside a mine. Greatly enhancing metal production,
   the mine improves the creation of metal-based goods, weapons and armors.<br />
   <b>Important:</b> A mine only works in regions with metal deposits. If the metal production of the region is zero, building
   a mine will not give any benefits.
 Palisade: >
   The most primitive type of fortification, a palisade is very useful against wild animals and roaming bandits, giving the
   inhabitants of a settlement a feeling of security.
 Paved Streets: >
   Paving the streets of the settlement allows for better transport especially with wheeled vehicles. Even more importantly,
   it makes travel more independent from weather, and is necessary for some large-scale constructions.
 Quarry: >
   An area set aside for the large scale excavation of granite, limestone, or similar usable construction material.
 Race Track: >
   Regardless of what is actually being raced, race tracks tend to boost the local economy either by drawing people to the city
   or by increasing morale, and thus a person's willingness to spend. Many also include formal betting houses, though the
   legitimacy of such establishments can vary from city to city.
 Regional Seat: >
   The Seat of Power for a March or Duchy, the Regional Seat supports the administration of such regional powers, and contains
   the various bureaucratic workers and offices that keep it all working.
 Royal Mews: >
   Larger and with more experienced breeders and trainers than the regular stables, the royal mews allow for the
   breeding and training of the rare and valuable war horses, massive steeds who won't panic in battle and will
   under a capable rider trample down an enemy.
 Royal Seat: >
   The Seat of Power for a Principality or Kingdom, the Royal Seat supports the administration of such royal realms, and contains
   the various bureaucratic workers and offices that keep it all working.
 Saddler: >
   A specialised craftsman who creates saddles, stirrups, bridles, reins and other gear for horses and carts.
 School: >
   A government-sponsored place of learning for a select few pupils will provide more educated people. It also
   provides and distributes knowledge, making more refined work flows and buildings possible.
 Shrine: >
   A small place of religious worship, often maintained by the locals and without a full-time priest.
 Stables: >
   The stables house and breed horses for both work and battle.
 Stone Castle: >
   Stronger and larger than a wooden fortification, the stone castle is a powerful defensive structure that an enemy can neither
   conquer nor destroy without siege weapons.
 Stone Towers: >
   Made of stone, these towers can be built higher than those made of wood, and are almost impossible to destroy except with the
   strongest siege technology.
 Stone Wall: >
   A solid stone wall is the symbol of a well-defended settlement. It cannot be burnt down and can only be broken through
   with massive siege engines.
 Tailor: >
   A basic craftsman providing the peasants with clothes of a higher quality than their home-made ones and also capable of
   creating large batches of tabards and even simple cloth armor.

   The village pub, or a collection of taverns and pubs for a larger settlement, this is where the peasants meet for
   their evening ale and some gossip.
 Temple: >
   A large place of religious worship, usually with one or more full-time priests as well as a number of helpers.
 Tournament Grounds: >
   A large compound of buildings for holding various tournaments.
 Town Hall: >
   A public building with room for offices, a public court and other administrative necessities of a growing town.
 Training Ground: >
   A large open space equipped for soldier training, allowing the training and recruitment of some basic types of
   soldiers.
 University: >
   The highest place of learning available to your people, the university is a center of knowledge and the foundation of some
   of the most rare and valuable experts.
 Warehouse: >
   Used to store goods and equipment of all kinds, it's best used for things that don't spoil. That said, it does provide a
   slight benefit to the local food production industry, if not always directly.
 Weaponsmith: >
   A specialised craftsman forging weapons. While most of his work is similar to the blacksmith, he also handles some woodwork
   for handles and uses more advanced smelting and forging techniques to create weapons capable of withstanding a higher
   amount of stress than the average farm tools require.
 Wood Castle: >
   An enclosed center of your military, with walls, towers, a guardhouse and fortified defenses. The wooden castle allows for
   excellent defenses and will hold even against attackers with considerable superior numbers.
 Wood Towers: >
   Adding towers to the fortifications of a settlement allows the defenders to fight back and increases the spotting distance
   of the settlement, allowing for early warnings.
 Wood Wall: >
   A more fortified and refined palisade, the wood wall encloses the settlement and provides it with basic defenses
   against wild animals, bandit and unorganized attackers.
