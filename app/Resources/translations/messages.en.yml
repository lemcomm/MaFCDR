 autologin:
  title:    Auto-Login
  intro: >
    This is an <b><i>experimental and possibly insecure</i></b> feature.<br />
    Auto-Login will save a token in your browser, which enables it to complete the login procedure fully automated, giving you one-click logins
    (simply click on "login" and you are in).<br /><br />
    <b>Security Advantage:</b> The token saved in your browser is not your password. In fact, when using auto-login, your password is not stored
    on your computer at all (unlike the password-manager functionality of most browsers) and is never transmitted across the Internet. If you
    lose or someone steals the token, simply click the enable button below again to generate a new token.<br />
    <b>Security Danger:</b> If someone gets access to your computer or browser, he can log in to the game without knowing your password. Do not
    use this feature if you share your computer with other people. Do not <i>activate</i> it while you are on an insecure network, because if
    someone captures the token sent when you click the button, he can use it. <i>Additionally, this feature has not yet been peer-reviewed by other
    security experts and may contain additional weaknesses unknown at this time.</i><br />

    Developing and running Might & Fealty is not free, so we charge a small monthly fee to play.<br />
    We believe in using a transparent, simple payment system instead of the various "Free2Play" or "Pay2Win" models that nag you about
    "premium features" constantly. In Might & Fealty, we want you to enjoy the game to the max without hiding features away into
    parts you have to pay extra for. There are, however, a few small limitations on free accounts.<br />

    The core culture that Might & Fealty represents is Central European. You can buy access to other cultures and decide for each of
    the settlements controlled by your characters which culture they belong to. Depending on the particular set, this always includes the
    names of soldiers and entourage recruited there and can also include visuals such as buildings, troops and entourage.<br />
    Once unlocked, a culture is yours forever and can be used by all of your characters as often as you like. You will also automatically get
    any updates to a culture pack (such as added graphics).

    You can invite your friends to the game and if they aren't sure they will love it, sweeten it by sending them some starting credits.<br />
    This will send an invitation e-mail to them, with a special invite code. Your credits will be put into escrow and used only if your
    friend actually signs up with the game. Until (s)he does, you can cancel the invite at any time by using the code yourself (you will
    get a copy of the mail, including the code).<br />
    <br />
    And since we like new players, you will get up to half of your credits back if your friend likes the game and becomes a subscriber. Yes,
    you can have your cake and eat it, too.<br />

 description: Create a new character or ancestor
 intro: >
   Enter the vital details of your new character below. Of these, only the name can later be changed, so pick carefully.<br />
   Please note that the character name should be a full name, including a surname. Characters of the same family
   should, obviously, share a surname unless their personal history provides a reason not to.<br />
   Your character <b>must</b> have a proper name, not a funny or silly or modern-Internet-speak one. It <b>must</b> be
   a plausible, actual name, not a title, codename or nom de guerre (titles, religious names and such can be added to your
   character once in the game). This rule is both for the atmosphere of the game and for your own benefit as many players
   frown upon silly names and diplomacy would be much harder. So please, proper names only.<br />
   Choosing a father and mother is optional, if you leave it empty then one or both of the parents will simply be
   people that don't exist as characters in the game. If you want to create a family tree, make sure to start
   with the oldest generations.<br />
   All characters are <a href="%firstoneurl%">First Ones</a> and begin the game as fully trained and equipped knights.

 title:     Welcome to Might & Fealty
 intro:
  realm: With the formal affiar of joining %realm% out of the way, the first thing you will probably want to do is introduce yourself to your new comrades in arms.
  subrealm: >
    That can be done either here in the subrealm, <a href="%conv%">here</a>, or sovereign realm, <a href="%conv2%">here</a>, where the local bureaucrats have already announced your arrival.
  sovrealm: >
    That can be done <a href="%conv%">here</a>, where the local bureaucrats have already announced your arrival.
  house: >
    With the formal affair of joining %house% out of the way, the first thing you will probably want to do is introduce yourself to your new comrades in arms. That can be done <a href="%conv-2%">here</a>.<br /><br />As you are starting in a House rather than a Realm, you may wish to ask for recommendations for which realm you should seek to join. It's quite likely that your fellows will have suggestions.
  nodesc: The staff wish you well on your travels and glory in your life. May your actions bring you and those they server renown.
  final: It is important to note that Might & Fealty tends to be a slow game, so don't expect much action in your first days. That said, it can be quite complex, as it tries to emulate the possibilities of real life as well as it can given the setting, so we do recommend reading the <a href="%manual%">the game manual</a> if you haven't already. Alternatively, <a href="%discord%">the community discord</a> can also be a great help.

  title:      Character Arrival Organizations
  intro:      Select the arrival organization for %name%. You can either choose to start in a Realm, a House, or, if your character has one already through their lineage, their own House. Realms can offer a variety of locations to start the game in, while Houses will only let you start at their Home. Houses do offer you the chance to start outside of a regular realm organization though, but <b>are very hard to leave</b>--generally requiring your character's death to do so.<br /><br />If you're unsure what whether to start in a Realm or a House, we suggest starting in a Realm.
  offer:      Accept fealty offer
  offerintro: >
    Many landed nobles offer a contingent of troops for loyal knights to fight in their name. Accepting one of these offers
    is the easiest way to start out.<br />
    Your character will automatically be placed in the estate of your new lord and receive the promised amount of troops. In
    addition, %he% will have an initial oath of fealty to the lord that made the offer.

    You can also select any non-independent settlement from the map below, and negotiate with its lords to get soldiers or how else
    to begin your quest. This is an advanced option only recommended if none of the above are available or you are looking for something
    special to start.

  realm:      Available Realm(s) to Join

  realmIsUltimate: This is a Sovereign Realm
  house:      Available House(s) to Join
  houseintro: Houses can be anything from a tribe to a family to a clan, and unlike Realms are generally permanent affairs. Once you're in one, it is <b>usually very hard to leave</b>. That said, they're not bound by realm borders and do offer their own means to keep in touch. If a character has children with someone in the same house, their child will be in that house automatically.

This will get you in their conversations, announce your arrival, and, hopefully, get you towards something to do fairly quickly. Even though your presence is announced, it is suggested that you also introduce yourself as well.<br /><br />Note: Might & Fealty is a slower game, so it's entirely possible you won't get a response for several hours.

description:
 scout: >
   Usually a fleet-footed peasant with good eyes, the scout will search the nearby area for anything
   unusual, notifying their liege of any finds.<br />
   Scouts increase your spotting range. The more scouts you have, the farther away you notice details of
   the land and other characters.
 prospector: >
   An expert in surveying and estimating, the prospector allows you to get data on the local economy and
   its capabilities. One prospector is enough, though you can choose to have more than one, just in case.
 merchant: >
   Just like a sword is best met with a sword, and a thief with a thief, merchants are useful for setting up
   trade deals without being robbed blind by the middle men.<br />
   One merchant is needed (and will stay behind) for each time you want to close a trade deal with more
   profitable transaction costs.
 spy: >
   Spies are versatile experts in subterfuge and information gathering, allowing you to infiltrate an
   enemy (or friendly, if you are so inclined) settlement and gather details about its military or
   political status.
 priest: >
   The record keepers and scribes as well as managers of day-to-day affairs of peasants such as births,
   marriages, etc.<br />
   Priests allow you to create elections.
 herald: >
   Announcer and runner for a First One, who is not only practically a requirement if you want to be taken seriously
   as a major player in politics and diplomacy. He allows you to send messages at spotting, rather than
   interaction distance. In addition, heralds allow you to announce claims to settlements.
 translator: >
   A scribe trained in foreign languages, the translator allows you to send messages to First Ones who do not speak
   or understand your language. One translator is enough, though you can choose to have more than one, just in
   case.
 scholar: >
   Trained in the arts of reading and writing, documentation and a dozen other arts and techniques that a proper
   noble cares little about, the scholar can at times be useful to gather and sort information and old documents.<br />
   Their main use is to discover more about the history of people and places.
 follower: >
   Camp followers are people following the soldiers in your army. They can be professionals, such as smiths, cooks
   or whores, or they can be relatives and family members of the soldiers. Camp followers allow your army to carry
   additional supplies and reserves, making resupply in the field possible.

 axe:             An old and fairly primitive weapon, nevertheless both deadly and common on the battlefield.
 broadsword:      A heavy and sturdy sword designed more for massive impact force than speed.
 chainmail:       Interlocking metal rings providing impressive armor and yet fairly low weight.
 cloth armour:    Reinforced clothing, basically several layers of thick cloth. Does not really make much of a difference against real weapons, but can help against weak or glancing blows.
 club:            There are many things that can be used as clubs, everything from axe handles to tree branches to even old blunted swords.
 crossbow:        Technically advanced ranged weapon that requires less training than a bow and provides more accurate power, but requires longer loading times.
 glaive:          A polearm consisting of a a single-edged blade on the end of a pole.
 great axe:       Sometimes referred to as a battle axe historically, in Might & Fealty this refers to the heavier two handed variety. On par with a broadsword.
 halberd:         A two handed pole weapon topped with a battle axe, a spike, and a hook, designed for grappling mounted foes.
 horse:           Riding horse trained to suffer through the heat of battle without too much complaining.
 improvised:      Farm tools, other tools, big sticks - anything that was lying around and just might hurt someone.
 javelin:         A short spear, balanced for throwing. One-use weapon that gives melee troops a single, but powerful ranged attack. Use with camp followers to resupply in the field.
 lance:           A long polearm utilized to great effectivceness by mounted solders. Powerful, but only good for a single use.
 leather armour:  Hardened leather in multiple layers, slightly hindering movement but providing considerable protection.
 longbow:         The ultimate one-man ranged weapon, requiring long training and strong arms to use. Can pierce even solid metal armor at great distances.
 machete:         A broad bladed knife that doubles as an agricultural implement. Much easier to train and produce than a sword, though not as effective.
 mace:            A stick with a spiky metal head. Feared on the battlefield because of its combination of powerful impact and small point, punching through even strong armour.
 morning star:    Sometimes referred to as a "ball and chain", the morning star bears similarity to a mace, save for the fact that the stick and the spiky ball are connected by a length of chain or tether.
 pavise:          A shield large enough to cover the entire body, commonly carried by archers and crossbowmen, but sometimes utilized by other infantry. Makes for a good thing to hide behind when under attack by ranged enemies.
 pike:            A long pole-arm weapon with a blade and point, easy to learn and often the first serious weapon for conscripts to pick up.
 plate armour:    The ultimate in armor protection, consisting of solid metal plates covering every part of the body, interlocked and reinforced.
 scale armour:    A mixture of metal and leather, the scale armor has a solid leather body with numerous metal plates overlayed, affording more freedom of movement than more solid metal armors.
 shield:          A primitive and yet highly efficient defensive choice, a shield protects against both melee and ranged attacks.
 shortbow:        A very common type of bow, used mainly for hunting but quite effective against lightly armored enemies, too.
 sling:           An easy to produce ranged weapon that is used to launch a, usually, blunt projectile.
 spear:           Another simple and common weapon, popular due to its considerable reach and easy training.
 staff:           A staff is a long rod, usually made of wood. While not as conventionally deadly as other things, it's reach and ease to create makes it a viable weapon.
 staff sling:     A sling attached to a long rod, providing longer range or the ability to launch heavier missiles or at steeper arcs.
 sword:           Rare among the lower ranks, common amongst the nobility and those who can afford proper weaponsmiths.
 short sword:     A smaller sidearm to be used mostly as a fallback melee option for ranged troops, or as reserve weapon.
 war horse:       A large and heavy horse, specifically trained for battle and equipped with horse armor.

    <p>The following stories are all in-character fiction, legends and myths from the Might & Fealty world that
    your character can hear or might even already know.</p>
    <p>Stories are often told or sung, rather than read, as most peasants can neither read nor write. Oral tradition
    is still very strong in the world of Might & Fealty, though many of the older or more popular legends have
    since been written down by scholars. There are, of course, also writers of fiction and song in the world, even if
    their works are more often performed than read.</p>

  intro: >
    You can create map markers and share them with members of the realm(s) that you belong to.<br />
    These markers will be visible to everyone in the realm, they will be able to see the marker on the map
    no matter where they are (no distance limit) and they can see the name you give it as well as the type
    that you select for it. At the moment, there are two types. One to designate enemies you have spotted and
    one to designate waypoints for coordinated army movement.<br />
    To make best use of markers, they should be accompanied with realm messages to explain in more detail
    what the marker means.<br />
    You can have at most 10 markers per character (to prevent abuse/spam).

  intro: >
    Here you can forge or create artifacts, unique items with a personal history.<br />
    Artifacts can be used for many purposes, from legendary weapons to hereditary crown jewels to items of
    religious or cultural significance. The important thing about artifacts is that they are unique items
    that can be given, stolen lost and found. They carry their own history.<br />
    As the creator of an artifact, you will always see if it is currently owned by someone and if so, by whom.
    When it is not in the posession of anyone, you can also reforge it, adding to it. But even you can never
    destroy it or change its past.<br />
    With artifacts, you directly contribute something permanent to the game world. To do so, give it a
    catchy name and a description that should detail what the item is (a sword, a crown, a ring, an old scroll, etc. -
    in any case it should be something that can easily be carried) and how it looks and what is special about it.<br />
    If you want it to start with a history (an old, legendary item), we recommend you hint at legends told
    and history lost, as the artifact will start its "official" history with creation.<br />
    <br />
    <em>Double-check everything you enter here, as you can not change it once the artifact is created.</em>

  intro:       Journals are player created messages about things in game. Most of the time these can be considered to be known things, as somethig your character heard via rumor, though they can also be flagged as out of character information that is really only meant for your enjoyment as a player rather than for use by your characters (unless they happen to know of it some other way.)

  intro:       Your journal is a place for you to write down your thoughts or record events from your view. It can also be used for other things, like as a repository of world information for your character's settings. Best of all, you can share these with others if you want, through the magic of the Lendan Stone network!<br><br>Be advsised that all content shared publicly MUST be safe for viewing for a teenager (13 years of age or older). Light swearing, is fine, but if you want to record your fantasies, make it private and/or graphic. Misuse of or failure to properly mark your journal entries may see all future entries forced to be marked private through GM action.
