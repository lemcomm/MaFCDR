Might & Fealty
==============

This is the old source code for the game [Might & Fealty](http://mightandfealty.com), a browser based, persistent, role playing game (RPG) with turn-based strategy elements written in PHP7.2 on the Symfony2.8 framework, using a PostgreSQL database for entity handling and QuantumGIS for map functionality.

Starting in 2025, this source code was replaced with the [ReMaF](https://github.com/lemcomm/ReMaF) source code, which brings it up to Symfony 6.4 using PHP 8.4. This was considered a large enough project that doing it as a new repository was seen as the simplest method to keep things simple to work on. If you'd like to go back in time instead, you can view [The Original Source](https://github.com/tvogt/mightandfealty) which used Symfony 2.7 and PHP 5.6.

All future development will be done as part of the [ReMaF](https://github.com/lemcomm/ReMaF) project, so this repository has been archived. The new project has better documentation as well as using new programming convetions.

Completeness
------------

The repository is **not** a complete standalone copy of the game. While it contains all the code, the game world data is missing. There is, also, old code in the repository that was **not** actually used to create the game world. To create a game world, you need additional scripts and manual work in something like QuantumGIS.
